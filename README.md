# game
This is a template for making a game with the PlayCanvas game engine and the valtan Common Lisp compiler by cxxxr.
It includes examples of cameras, keyboard movement, models and animations all in Common Lisp.

I am currently in the process of refactoring everything to use the CLOS instead of straight FFI calls.
In the meantime, what is here generally works even if the code is ugly and contradictory in many places.

The PlayCanvas engine, valtan, and the code and assets in this repository fall under the MIT license
at the time of writing this. See the relevant repositories for more information.
